## Vessel ID 50 from next file has a good example of a true torsion spike, and elimination of false torsion spikes.  Downside is correct epsilon ball around zero is 10 times bigger than the other examples from different image set.  Still worth trying this approach, coding up somehow for Kaitlin to examine.

## 35 from this one.

## Testing with human brain data.  Use # 89 from "BG0001_png_vd_619x619x620_um" dat file is good, although the actual # 89 value may have changed with recent thresholding...

vessels_slice <- dat_file_reader(dat_filename = filename)

## Run the View() function to see the structure of the vessels_slice data.frame.  Note that it contains rescaled coordinates for the vessel backbones (in units of micrometers) and the fourth column is a factor for vessel ID numbers.  Note that these IDs are NOT the same as the vessel nodeids from your other .tsv files.  Integration of the correct vessel ID names happens after performing tortuosity analyses.

View(vessels_slice)

## Quickly use the RGL packages plot3d function to get a coarse view of all vessels in the slice.
nopen3d()
plot3d(vessels_slice[,1:3], col = vessels_slice$ID)

## Alternatively, use the custom made single_vessel_plotter() function for viewing individual vessels.  Index via the which function to capture individual vessels based on their ID number.

# Extracting an individual vessel.  Note that we have also indexed so as to remove the ID column from our single vessel.
# Try  3, 12, 25, 32
vessel <- vessels_slice[which(vessels_slice$ID == 35), 1:3]

# Note the use of the new function call to nopen3d().  This function allows for panning in the viewing window by pressing and holding down on the track pad with two fingers and scrolling.

nopen3d()
single_vessel_plotter(vessel_coords = as.matrix(vessel), centered = TRUE, frenet = FALSE, new = TRUE)

## Run the new version of vessel_spline_fit using the spline parameter "pspline" for the method that automates the task of identifying the ideal fit.  In short, the spline method itself determines the ideal smoothing parameter via a leave-one-out cross-validation method for a given number of spline knots.  The method we have coded adds onto this a process to increment the number of knots and test the subsequent fits against one another using an AIC score comparison.  The bulk of this next project will be examining the tortuosity measurements under the following conditions.  (i) Vary the first entry in the "m" parameter from m(2,2) to m(3,2) to m(4,2) to examine resulting fits.  This variation changes the exponent of the spline polynomials being used, which in turn influences the number of derivatives to which continuity is maintained.  The current expectation is that m(4,2) should provide the fits that are "better behaved" for higher order derivatives, and thus measures of torsion.  Experiment with these three cases only for the vessels that were previously studied during the summer, so that we can compare the pspline method to the previous cases of identifying smoothing parameters by hand.  (ii) After completing part (i), we should schedule to meet and discuss the results.  But, in the meantime, pick the m() parameter that seemed to perform best, or in the case that they are all as good as the others, pick the m(4,2) parameter, and experiment with the "scale_up_tortuosity_measures_whole_slice_worksheet.R" file to bulk/batch analyze whole slices for the NIH, IH, and PI regions.  By experiment, I literally mean get creative with how to analyze and compare the measures of tortuosity in the NIH, IH, and PI groups.  Up until now we have mainly been testing our methods to improve them using small samples from these three groups (and there is plenty more testing and improving of our methods to do).  However, I think we are at a good place to start using our methods to look for large scale differences between the groups.  Some suggested plots to consider, (iia) histograms of different tortuosity metrics, (iib) xy-scatter plots of different tortuosity metrics (for example, MT vs. MC) to look for correlation/covariation, (iic) coloring all vessels in a slice by the curvature and torsion metrics.

##Note that outputs from these functions will be the x, y, and z compoents of the tangent, normal and binormal Frenet vectors, as well as reprinting the x, y, and z coordinates of the voxel backbones.  Also note that the output from these functions are lists of matrices.


# Here we try the pspline method of interpolation with m = c(4,2).
vessel_spline_fit(vessel = vessel, number_samples = 20000, spline = "pspline", m = c(4,2), plot = TRUE, aic_slope = 5)

# Note that we have also added versatility for selection of a subsample_density.  For now, we will use subsample_density = 2, which should approximately mean 2 points per micrometer.
smth_vessel <- vessel_spline_fit(vessel = vessel, number_samples = 20000, spline = "pspline", aic_slope = 5, m = c(4,2), plot = TRUE, subsample_density = 100)

## For vessel #50 from Microsphere day 7 PI images, need to remove first 4% of points.
smth_vessel$tangent <- smth_vessel$tangent[-c(1:50),]
smth_vessel$normal <- smth_vessel$normal[-c(1:50),]
smth_vessel$binormal <- smth_vessel$binormal[-c(1:50),]
smth_vessel$vssl_coords <- smth_vessel$vssl_coords[-c(1:50),]

## Now that we have smoothed interpolated vessels, we can add the Frenet vectors to the visualizaitons if we like when using single_vessel_plotter().

nopen3d()
single_vessel_plotter(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]], centered = TRUE, frenet = FALSE, scale = 1.0, col = "purple", frenet_vectors = seq(from = 1, to = nsrow(smth_vessel[[4]]), by = 1))

## Next we'll make graphs of curvature and torsion, as functions of normalized vessel arc length, using the curve_torse_check_plotter() function.

# To graph curvature and torsion, use plot_type = 1
setwd("/Users/alexwork/Desktop/")
curve_torse_check_plotter(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]], plot_type = 1, type = "p", filter_torsion_spikes = FALSE, filter_tolerance = 0.01, save_plot = FALSE)
curve_torse_check_plotter(vessel_coords = smth_vessel, plot_type = 1, type = "l", filter_torsion_spikes = TRUE, filter_tolerance = 0.1, save_plot = FALSE)

# To graph curvature and error in curvature, use plot_type = 2
curve_torse_check_plotter(vessel_coords = smth_vessel, plot_type = 2, filter_torsion_spikes = TRUE)

# To graph torsion and error in torsion, use plot_type = 3
curve_torse_check_plotter(vessel_coords = smth_vessel, plot_type = 3, filter_torsion_spikes = TRUE)

## To extract various measures of tortuosity, we can use a combination of the functions curvature_torsion_calculator(), distance_metric(), inflection_count_metric, and sum_of_all_angles_metric().  The former of these four methods measures produces multiple metrics all directly related to curvature and torsion.  These are: total and average and maximum curvature and torsion, as well as total and average combined curvature and torsion.  These metrics are discussed in O'Flynn et al., 2007.  The latter three mtrics of distance, inflection count, and sum of all angles are discussed in Bullitt et al., 2003.

cur_tor_met <- curvature_torsion_calculator(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]][-c(1:50),], filter_torsion_spikes = FALSE, filter_tolerance = 0.1)

## Distance metric returns both the arclength and the arclength divided by the end-to-end distance
dist_met <- distance_metric(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]])

## Inflection count metric can be toggled to return either the number of inflection points, or the values of the (Delta N)**2 term as a function of vessel arclenth which indicate inflection points when (Delta N)**2 > 2.  Note that this method is likely mis-identifying true inflection points as the above formula is not well defined for 3D curves, but only 2D curves.
inflec_met <- inflection_count_metric(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]], return_count = TRUE, return_coords = FALSE)
inflec_met <- inflection_count_metric(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]], return_count = FALSE, return_coords = TRUE)

## Sum of all angles metric returns the sum of all angles as defined in Bullitt et al., 2003.  Note that this method, adopted by many, is incorrectly calculating spikes in the torsion values if not handled appropriately.

soam <- sum_of_all_angles_metric(smth_vessel[[4]])

## We can plot some tortuosity metrics on the vessels them selves using color coding.  Here are two examples using curvature and torsion to color the vessel.


# Coloring by curvature.
nopen3d()
single_vessel_plotter(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]], centered = TRUE, frenet = FALSE, col_metric = cur_tor_met$curvature)


# Coloring by torsion
nopen3d()
single_vessel_plotter(vessel_coords = smth_vessel[[4]], centered = TRUE, frenet = FALSE, col_metric = cur_tor_met$torsion, scale = 0.05, frenet_vectors = seq(from = 1050, to = 1150, by = 10))



## Use the above code to experiment with different different fitting parameters for different vessels (and from different slices).  More detailed instruction will come after the weekend.
